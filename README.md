## ‚ùì Game Mechanics:
### Difficulty:
1. Whenever Mobs spawn, they will be divided into two subcategories: Friendly, or Hostile.
2. Friendly mobs are mobs that have no purpose when killed, and may have a major purpose to players, most being tamable, and some not being tamable. Ex: horses, wolves, dolphins, etc.
3. Hostile mobs are the rest, mobs that are either hostile, neutral, or offer something important upon killing them. Ex: farm animals, zombies, creepers, skeletons, etc.
4. All mobs will spawn with increased health (x1.5).
5. Hostile mobs have even further increased health (x2.8 ~ 3), attack damage (x1.75 ~ 2), armor (+6 ~ 12), and movement speed (+10~20%).
6. When hostile mobs die, their exp dropped is increased based on their health and the killer player's Experience Multiplier attribute.
7. Some Zombie-type mobs may spawn as "Infested", spawning further of the same type when they are killed.
